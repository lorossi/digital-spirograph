# Digital Spirograph
My parents never bought me a spirograph when I was a child... but now I can code. And I knew I had to do this.

There isn't really much to say. Just play around by using the form, change circles sizes and speeds.
If you like your creation, save it by clicking on "record". It might take a while but you will get your video in a .gif file.

Have fun!
